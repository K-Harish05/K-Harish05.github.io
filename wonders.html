        <h2>The Taj Mahal</h2></center>
        <h3>The Taj Mahal welcomes an astonishing 35 to 40 thousand visitors every day â€” and with busy seasons,it is no stranger to upto 8 million visitors annually.The origin of this marbled expression of love lies in the celebrated reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan 400 years ago. This leader had a desire to build a monument to the object of his affection and favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Ultimately, it exists as a tomb for her, but she is certainly one of the few people who will not be forgotten as time goes by.</h3>
